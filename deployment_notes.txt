Deployment options

Standar Build and Full static build

Standard build (next build)
    produces optimized production bundles and a server-side app: requieres nodejs server
    pages are pre-rendered, but nodejs server is required for API routes, server-side pages and page revalidations
    re-deploy needed if code changes or you don't use revalidations

Fullstack build (next export)
    produces 100% static app (hmtl, css, javascript): no node js server required
    doesn't work if your app uses API routes, server side pages or wants to use page revalidations
    re-deploy needed for all code and content changes
